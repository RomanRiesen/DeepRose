# DeepRose

Play it **[here](https://romanriesen.github.io/DeepRose/)**.



This is my playground for different approaches to AI design, where I build up everything form the ground.
Implemented are:
* Taking random turns
* MinMax
* Evolutionary learning of MinMax params
Planned / partially implemented are:
* Alpha-beta prunning for the MinMax search
* Some sort of reinforcement learning


The game itself is "inspired" by [Rosenk√∂nig](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenk%C3%B6nig)  (German only wikipedia article)
