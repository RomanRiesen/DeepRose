This is my playground for different approaches to AI design, where I build up everything form the ground.

Implemented are:
    * Taking random turns
    * MinMax
    * Evolutionary learning of MinMax params


Planned are:
    * Alpha-beta prunning for the MinMax search
    * Some sort of reinforcement learning

The game itself is "inspired" by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenk%C3%B6nig] Rosenkönig (only german wikipedia article)
